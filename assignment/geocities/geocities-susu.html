        张是我的姓氏，是中国人口最多的姓氏之一。据传说这个姓氏来自于古时候一个蛮夷部落叫长国。
        这个国家虽然很早就破灭了，但是这个国家常出有谋略之士，长国人擅长作为各朝各代的幕僚
        所以可以超越许多皇族姓氏，成为中国的大姓。
        诗的意思是诗词、诗人，父母希望我成为一个有艺术气息的人。
        绮是绮丽美丽的意思。

    <p>
        我来自中国重庆。重庆是在中国西南的一个直辖市。是一个人口超过三千万的城市。
        出名的原因是奇特的地形与建筑造成的视觉与空间感觉错觉。最出名的特产是火锅。
        我现在最想吃但是吃不到的家乡菜是草包牛肉，希望芝加哥的厨师能够听到我内心的呼唤。

         我在芝加哥艺术学院学习，但是我不知道我在搞什么艺术，我不觉得我在搞艺术，是艺术在搞·我。
         我不就是一个偶尔随波逐流的普通人。学这么多写这么多作业都是为了爸妈断粮后不饿死。我知道想不饿死
         就不该学艺术，我也不知道，我很苦恼特别是在每次交学费的时候，感觉我被这个世界艹了。总觉得我
         一辈子都赚不回我的学费。而我爸妈却一点都不着急，总让我别总想着钱与打工。大哥，说不会留一分钱
         给我的也是你们啊。我当然知道我足够幸运，至少有人无偿为我负担学费。我总感觉我的生活太不真实，可能我只是
        模拟人生里的一个角色。

            My Chinese name is Shiqi Zhang. 
            Zhang is my surname, one of the most populous surnames in China. 
            According to legend, this surname came from a barbarian tribe called Chang'guo in ancient times. 
            Although this country was conquered very early, this tribe has many talents, especially political 
            and military talents, thus,Chang’guo people are good at serving as ministers of various dynasties and generations.
           Subsequently, Zhang can surpass many imperial surnames and become China's major surnames. 
           Shi means poetry. My parents want me to be an artistic person. Qi means beautiful or silk fabrics.

        I am from Chongqing, China. Chongqing is a municipality in southwest China. 
        It is a city with a population of more than 30 million.
         The reason why Chongqing is famous is the illusion of vision and space caused by the peculiar topography and architecture (for example, there’s no absolute ground floor in Chongqing. 
         In one building 1st floor, 2nd floor, ground floor, and lobby floor can all connect to ground due to the hill terrain). 
         The most famous specialty is hot pot. The hometown dish I want to eat the most but cannot eat is grass-wrapped beef (grass=spring onion+Chinese cilantro ). 
         I hope the chefs in Chicago can hear my inner call.

        I studied at the Art Institute of Chicago, but I don’t know what art I am doing. I don’t think I am doing art. Art is doing me.
        I am not just an ordinary person who sometimes goes with the crowd. I’m learning so much and write so much homework so that I don’t starve to death when my parents decide not to give me any support at all. I know if I don't want to starve to death, I probably shouldn’t study art.
        I’m very upset, especially every time I pay tuition, I feel like I’m being fooled by the world. Always feel like I won't earn back my tuition for a lifetime. But my parents are not at all in a hurry. They don't want me think about money and work. But they are the ones who said that they wouldn't leave a penny to me.
         Of course I know that I am lucky enough that at least someone will pay for my tuition for free. I just feel that my life is just unreal. Perhaps someone plays me in their world’s sims.
